WELCOME TO THE FINALE OF HALF-LIFE 2 BOOBY TRAPPED.

It's been a pleasure, and I do apologize for the long wait, but I hope you feel it was worth it.

mbramblet has whipped out a hardcore edition of the ProPane mod, for which we finish today...

## Additional Notes

This video took a lot longer than initally expected, as I've been dying on the motivational train.

Though I was able to finish it and I'm glad to put the series behind us.

Still gotta edit the first part of Half-Life 2 Randomizer, but I have something coming June 1st, so stay tuned!

## Edits

There are none yet, but if I do happen to edit anything noteworthy, I will notate here!

Did I get something wrong? Do you hate my opinion? Do you have additional thoughts about my blabbering???
