## Additional Notes

Nothing too crazy! I'm glad Michael was able to edit this together so quickly. 

I hate I've been slacking on editing Booby Trapped Part 3 & HL2 Randomizer, and Portal: Randomized has halted progress too.

I've been busy, sick and going through it but I'm pulling myself out of it.

Did I get something wrong? Do you hate my opinion? Do you have additional thoughts about my blabbering???
