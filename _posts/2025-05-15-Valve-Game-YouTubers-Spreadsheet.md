Information copied from spreadsheet :)

## What is this?

This is a compilation of all the Valve game YouTubers I really like.
I went through every one of my YouTube subscriptions and divided them into two different categories:

### Best of the Best

Includes YouTubers I've watched at least 99% of their content. 
If they post a video, I will almost certainly watch it and almost immediately if possible.

### Honorable Mentions

I am still subscribed to these YouTubers, but I may not watch all of what they post. 
Some of these YouTubers don't make Source game content anymore, or sometimes content at all (very sadly).

## Why did you make this?

I love Valve games and I love watching YouTube. It's what I mostly absorb when I want to sit down and watch something.

I wanted to share my love for watching these videos and the work that these creators put into their creations.

Maybe you know all of these YouTubers, but maybe not? At any rate, I hope you have as much fun watching them as I did.

## Where is Deadlock? Or whatever other obscure Source game I love???

These are just my personal favorites. Maybe more will be added.

## Where is MY favorite YouTuber? Why do you <span style="color:red">HATE</span> them???

Holy shit calm down! These are just the ones I like, but maybe that person is really good and I haven't seen their videos yet.

This would be a good opportunity to introduce the [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1kmpjs6/i_made_a_spreadsheet_of_all_my_favorite_valve/) I made about this. 
Go comment there and let me know what you think, and who you think I missed!

## Additional Information

Sadly the Reddit post flopped and got downvoted, so I don't think this will get traction at all.

If you dislike Reddit and want to comment about here instead, please tell me what you think. :)

### Where have I been?

For all the blog-goers, I've been in a lull just working and gaming.

It's been hard to be creative recently, but I'm trying in my baby steps, like with this here.

If you're reading this, your support means the world to me and I would encourage you to leave a comment.
I would be honored.
