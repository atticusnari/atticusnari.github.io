THIS VIDEO WILL SELF DESTRUCT AFTER FULL VIDEO HAS RELEASED

Spend a minimum of $5 to access the rough cut of the last edition in the *"Can you beat Half-Life 2 Booby Trapped?"* series. 
Already a supporter? Great because you get access to this by default! 

This rough cut is basically the entire video all but the death counters, a myriad of edits and 
a special shout out to YOU! That's right! Become a supporter before the final edit 
and you'll be shouted out in the video!

On top of all of that, if you're late to the rough cut game but still want a perk, 
you'll have access to the video at least **48 hours before ANYONE ELSE!**

Video is hosted on YouTube and will require your email address attached to your YouTube account.
